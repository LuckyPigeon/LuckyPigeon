1. Error: error installing: Post http://localhost:8080/apis/extensions/v1beta1/namespaces/kube-system/deployments: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8080: connect: connection refused
1.1 Needs minikube started before, but I find out my docker is not in the group, so I re-add my docker to the group
1.2 After restart and check my docker is in the group, I use minikube start again, but this time seems my virutalbox kernel encounter some problem. I use $sudo /sbin/vboxconfig to rebuild kernel and it fail, then I use dmesg to check and find out one of plugin of my kernel install incompletely. Which my ubuntu 1604 has encounter the same issue and didn't solve eventually.
1.3 Try to setup virtualbox with a vdi file and failed, error: VERR_VM_DRIVER_INSTALLED-The support driver is not installed. On linux, open returned ENOENT
