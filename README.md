How I do the Music Downloader. If you are a new to crawler, and you want to practice your skill with your crawler, you can find song info at KKBox music rank's /body/script/text/ of KKBOX song ranking url.
And if you want to do a efficient work, you can get KKBOX's info with official API. Here's the API URL with tutorial:
https://docs-en.kkbox.codes/docs/getting-started

And then I search the music name with youtube, and get the info I want at /commandMetadata/webCommandMetadata

The last thing I do is go to a video converter website and convert the youtube url to a .mp3 file
